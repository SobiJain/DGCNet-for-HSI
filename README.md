# Hyperspectral Image Classification

This repository implementates 6 frameworks for hyperspectral image classification based on PyTorch and sklearn.

The detailed results can be seen in the [Classification of Hyperspectral Image Based on 
Double-Branch Dual-Attention Mechanism Network](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/3/582).
